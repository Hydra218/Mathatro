# Contributing to JOhn 

## Getting started with contributing

## Submission guidelines

### Issue submission

Before submitting an issue, search through the list to see if it has already been brought up.

To submit an issue, follow these steps:

1. Pick one of the two templates provided (do not pick the create blank issue option)
2. Do not remove any prompts. If any prompts are irrelavent, fill the field with 'N/A'
3. Add any additional information in the 'Additional context' field
4. Add any appropriate labels
5. Identify the issue type as bug, feature or task

### Pull requests

Any pull requests made must follow this set of rules:

- Pull requests must only be created once the changes are ready to be merged. A [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) may be made if changes aren't ready to be merged yet
- The author of the pull request should be put as the assignee by default
- Git Actions that scan for styling & vulnerabilities **must pass** before a pull request can be merged.
- A PR **must** have an approving review before it can be merged.
- A PR is to be merged **only** by the author
- **For Reviewers:** before approving a pull request, spend time testing to make sure it doesn't break anything. You may also request changes or just leave a comment - [read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews).

## Getting in touch?

Any contact from contributors should be left in the form of issues submitted.
